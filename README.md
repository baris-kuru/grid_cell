# grid_cell

grid_cell is a computational model including:
- mathematically modelled entorhinal grid cell outputs
- implementation of phase precession  in spike phases relative to hippocampal theta oscillations
- integration of these to a biophysically realistic model of dentate gyrus [pyDentate] (https://github.com/danielmk/pyDentate) to investigate pattern separation phenomenon.


If you encounter problems with running pyDentate or have questions feel free to contact me (barisckuru@gmail.com)
