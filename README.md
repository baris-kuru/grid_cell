# grid_cell

grid_cell is a computational model including:
- mathematically modelled entorhinal grid cells which have multiple firing fields arranged regularly in hexagonal, grid like pattern 
- implementation of phase precession  in spike phases relative to hippocampal theta oscillations
- a perceptron-based decoder to compare encoding speeds of rate code, phase code and complex(rate-phase) code 
- integration of these to a biophysically realistic model of dentate gyrus, pyDentate, to investigate pattern separation on types of grid cell population code
